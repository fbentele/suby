A Java Subsonic Client

I was sick of all the web and standard players (clients) for subsonic music server, so I started to create my own. Well java isn't really it so I kind of dropped further development.


To build you probably need to fix javafx path errors, run:
mvn com.zenjava:javafx-maven-plugin:2.0:fix-classpath
